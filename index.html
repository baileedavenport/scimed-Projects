    <h2> Why Goldilocs Was Wrong</h2>

    <body> Goldilocs was wrong for going in to the house because it wasn't her house to go into</body>
    <h3> Now The Story...</h3>
    <caption>Goldilocs did wrong but that wasn't her intention</caption>
    <p>One day in the deep dark woods a girl by the name of Goldilocs was on her way home when she got really hungry and she
      coudln't wait to eat. She say a little brick house in the distance and yelled with joy. Goldi rushes with full speed
      on the way to what she thought was destiny. (later to figure out......IT WASN'T) </p>
    <p>As Goldi reaches to knock on the door it creeks open slowly. She screams "ANYONE HOME", no response, not a bird chirp
      not a cricket stridulating. She calls again "ANYONE, ANYONE AT ALL" still...nothing, nothing at all.</p>
    <p>She slowly walks in, the floor creeply and quietly creeks, she stops in fright and stands still with fear in her eyes.
      Goldi slowly keeps walking until she comes to what she's been looking for this whole journey...FOOD!!Goldi's fear is
      quickly replaced with joy and overwelming happiness. There sitting in front of her 3 different sixe bowls full of porridge,
      and this is where her nightmare begin</p>
    <p>Goldi quickly picks up the first bowl it's bigger than the other ones and has more porridge in it, she picks up the ginormous
      spoon and raises it to her mouth. Less than 5 seconds later she drops the porridge on the ground as she screams "that
      was TOO HOT" Since she's still hungry she moves on to the next one, this bowl was the smallest of them all. She takes
      the tiny spoon and raises it to her mouth just like before. Goldi spits it back into the bowl with disgust "this one
      it too cold"
    </p>
    <p>The last bowl she saw she looked at in aww, it was the perfect amount in a beautiful gold glistening bowl. She slowly
      and satisfyingly brings the spoon to her mouth and her eye widen in shock, it was some of the best porridge she had
      ever tasted but also just might be the last.
    </p>
    <p> Goldi roamed the house for a while to try and figure out who it belonged to, but she started to become sleepy and drousy
      so when she found the beds she hopped from bed to bed, the first one was too big and firm, the second one was too small
      and soft. The last one she thought was a great combination of soft and firm but also the perfect size. She doused off
      and then... came the bears.
    </p>
    <p>The bears all seemed very happy, they were coming from there morning walk and felt great. Until, they saw their door
      was open. In fear and suspince papa bear moves mama bear and baby bear away from the door, slowly creeks open the door
      and top toes in.</p>
    <p>Papa bear sees the damage but nothing else, the more he creeps he starts to motion mama and baby bear in. They creep
      slowy into the house staying far behind papa bear. He screams.... there she was, poor ole Goldi dead on the bed. When
      the police arrived they said the cause of death was food poisoning.</p>
