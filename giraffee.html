            <h1>My Giraffe Project</h1>
            <p>Giraffa, aka Giraffes, are the largest terrestrial animals and largest ruminants animals in the world. Giraffes
                legs alone are taller than most humans, up to 6 feet tall. They are found in the dry savannas of Africa,
                giraffes are very social animals that roam around in groups called towers. Normally 15 members and led by
                a male giraffee. Giraffes compete to see who's stronger by fight by butting their long necks and heads known
                as necking. In the wild these animals can live up to 25 years old, but in captivity can reach 40 years old.</p>
            <p>Female giraffes ,known as cows, give birth standing up so new borns are born with a 1.5m drop to the ground.With
                in 30 mins they are standing and just hours later running with their mother.A giraffeâ€™s neck is too short
                to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread or bend its front legs to reach the ground for
                a drink of water. Giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that
                in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time. Before people thought giraffes didnt make nouse
                now we know giraffes bellow, snort, hiss and make flute-like sounds, as well as low pitch noises beyond the
                range of human hearing. </p>
